## Background

- Traffic accidents are a major public health problem, with more than 1.35 million deaths and tens of millions of injuries worldwide each year.
- One of the most important causes of traffic accidents is failure to comply with traffic lights and signs.
- The use of AI for traffic lights and traffic sign detection has the potential to reduce the number of traffic accidents caused by non-compliance.
- These systems can help enforce road rules and prevent collisions by providing real-time information and alerts to drivers. 

## Objectives

- The use of AI for traffic lights and traffic sign detection has the potential to reduce the number of traffic accidents caused by non-compliance.
- The system proposes a new approach based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to detect traffic signs in real-time video streams.
- It also presents a case study of its implementation and evaluation in a real-world scenario, and its implications and potential impacts on traffic safety are discussed.

## SDG Relations

- Sustainable Cities and Communities
- Climate Action

## Sustainable Cities and Communities Relation

- The project directly contributes to Sustainable Development Goals, particularly towards Sustainable Cities and Communities by enhancing road safety. 
- Through improved traffic sign detection, we aim to create safer urban environments, promoting better traffic management and reducing road accidents within cities. 

## Climate Action  Relation

- By enabling efficient navigation and adherence to traffic regulations, our system supports Climate Action objectives by potentially reducing traffic congestions and subsequently lowering vehicle emissions, contributing to a cleaner and greener environment.

## Datasets
- [The German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB)](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/2) _(label: easyfix)_ <br> is a widely used dataset for traffic sign recognition. It consists of more than 50,000 images of traffic signs, including speed limit signs, stop signs, and warning signs.
